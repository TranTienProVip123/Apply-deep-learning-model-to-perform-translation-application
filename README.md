# Apply-deep-learning-model-to-perform-translation-application
The Language Translator project is an application for translating text from English to Vietnamese and vice versa. The application allows users to input text, upload text or image files for translation, as well as input text via voice.
Introduce
* Topic and reason for choosing the topic:
This project aims to build an Automatic Text Translation application, combining both natural language processing technology and machine translation technology. The reason for choosing the topic is to improve the ability to communicate and access multilingual information, while taking advantage of modern technology to help users save time and effort in translating and understanding text content. . Copy.

* Objectives and scope of the topic:
Goal: Build an application that automatically translates text from the source language to the target language, while providing auxiliary features such as sentiment analysis, content search, and text-to-speech conversion.

*Scope: Focus on developing simple desktop applications, supporting text translation from English to Vietnamese and vice versa, using modern natural language processing and machine translation technology.
Using the Transformers deep learning model, LSTM:
The use of deep learning transformers and LSTM models brings many important benefits to language translation applications. First, these models are often highly efficient at translating languages ​​thanks to being trained on large amounts of data. Their effectiveness is also reflected in their flexible multilingual translation capabilities, which reduces the time and effort required for multilingual translation application development.
1/ Applications of natural language processing
NLP is increasingly being applied. Some applications include:
 Speech recognition (Automatic Speech Recognition – ASR, or Speech To Text – STT) converts language from speech to text, often used in voice control programs.
 Speech synthesis (Speech synthesis or Text to Speech – TTS) converts language from text to speech, often used in automatic text reading.
 Information Retrieval (IR) is responsible for finding documents in unstructured form (usually text) that meet information needs from large aggregated sources. The most popular information retrieval systems include search engines such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing search. These tools accept a natural language query as input and produce a list of documents sorted by relevance.
 Information Extraction (IE) identifies a number of predefined entity types, relationships between entities, and events in natural language text. Unlike information retrieval, which returns a list of valid documents, information extraction returns exactly the information the user needs. This information can be about people, places, organizations, dates, or even company names, product models or prices.
2/Human-machine interface based on natural language
- Today, many computer systems/programs have the ability to communicate with humans through natural language, either in text form, or in voice form. Typical applications that communicate in text form include information search, chatbots, and machine translation. Voice communication applications such as virtual assistants, voice search (phones, TVs), and voice control (phones, home devices).
- Figure 2 depicts the typical architecture of a computer program that communicates with humans through voice. The program will include the following basic steps:
+ Voice recognition: in this step, the computer will recognize the user's request in voice form and convert this request into text form.
+ Request processing: the computer will analyze the request in text form, process it, and give an answer using word processing techniques.
+ Speech synthesis: in this step, the answer will be converted from text to speech and sent to the user.

3. CONCLUSION
3.1. Summary of the topic and achieved results:
This project is a language translation application built in Python and uses a graphical interface using the Tkinter library. Below are some notable results that the project has achieved:
Language Translation App: App that allows users to enter text or upload a text file to translate from one language to another.
Simple and Easy-to-Use Interface: The user interface is designed to be simple and clear, making it easy for users to enter text, select a language, and view translation results.
Sentiment Analysis: The application provides a function to analyze the sentiment of the translated text to determine its positivity, negativity or neutrality.
Integrated Search and Text-to-Speech Conversion: In addition to translation functions, the application also provides the ability to search within text and convert translated text to speech.
Voice Recognition Support: The application allows users to enter text via voice, with the ability to recognize and convert audio into text.
3.2.Future development directions:
